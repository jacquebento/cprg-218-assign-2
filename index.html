            <h2>Birth and Family Life</h2>
            <p>
                Jane Austen came into the world on December 16th, 1775. Born to Reverend George Austen of the Steventon rectory and Cassandra Austen of the Leigh family. She was to be their seventh child and only the second daughter to the couple. Her siblings were made up largely of brothers, which in some ways forced a close relationship with her elder sister, Cassandra (not to be confused with the mother whom also carried the name Cassandra - but further referred to as Mrs. Austen). In order of birth, the Austen children were as follows: James, George, Edward, Henry, Cassandra, Francis, Jane and Charles. Of all the brothers, it would be Henry to which Jane would form the closest bond with, playing the part of Jane's literary agent in the later stages of her writing.            </p>

        <div class="panel">
          <p>Jane Austen was primarily educated at home, benefiting from her father’s extensive library and the schoolroom atmosphere created by Mr. Austen’s live-in pupils.

            Though she lived a quiet life, she had unusual access to the greater world, primarily through her brothers. Francis (Frank) and Charles, officers in the Royal Navy, served on ships around the world and saw action in the Napoleonic Wars. Henry, who eventually became a clergyman like his father and his brother James, was an officer in the militia and later a banker. Austen visited Henry in London, where she attended the theater, art exhibitions, and social events and also corrected proofs of her novels. Her brother Edward was adopted by wealthy cousins, the Knights, becoming their heir and later taking their name. On extended visits to Godmersham, Edward’s estate in Kent, Austen and her sister took part in the privileged life of the landed gentry, which is reflected in all her fiction.</p>

        <button class="accordion">Austen on Screen</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>The enduring popularity of Austen’s books can be seen in the numerous film and television adaptions of her work. These include Ang Lee’s Sense and Sensibility (1995), which starred Emma Thompson (who also wrote the Academy Award-winning screenplay) and Kate Winslet. Pride and Prejudice was notably adapted into a 1940 movie starring Greer Garson and Laurence Olivier and a 1995 TV miniseries with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth. Other film adaptations of Pride and Prejudice include Bride & Prejudice (2004), directed by Gurinder Chadha and starring Aishwarya Rai Bachchan; a 2005 film featuring Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen; and Fire Island (2022), starring Joel Kim Booster. Mansfield Park was covered in a 1983 miniseries, a 1999 film, and a 2007 TV movie. Treatments of Emma include a 1996 TV movie, a 1996 film starring Gwyneth Paltrow, and a 2020 movie. In addition, Bridget Jones’s Diary (2001) was based on Pride and Prejudice, and Clueless (1995) was inspired by Emma.</p>
